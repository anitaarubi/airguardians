# AirGuardians Project  
## Steps to Run the Project (Alternate Method)  
### 1\. Clone the repository:  
Open a terminal/command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/Anukuga/AirGuardians.git`

### 2\. Navigate to the project directory:  
Change into the project directory with:  
`cd AirGuardians`

### 3\. Run the start.bat script:  
The batch script (start.bat) is used to start all the components of the application (backend, sample data generator, and frontend). To run it, simply execute the following command:  
`start.bat`  
This will start three processes:

**Backend:** The Flask backend application (app.py).  

**Sample Data Generator:** A separate process running sample_data.py to simulate sample data in real time.  

**Frontend**: A React application started via npm start from the frontend directory.

### 4. Access the application:  
Once the script has run, you can access the application on your local machine:  
```
Frontend: http://localhost:3000  
Backend: http://localhost:5000
```

### Explanation of the Batch Script  
**Backend:** The script runs the Flask backend application (app.py), which serves the API endpoints for the application.

**Sample Data:** A separate process runs sample_data.py, which simulates sample data generation in real time for use in the application.

**Frontend:** The script navigates to the frontend directory and starts the React application by running npm start.

### Current Limitations  
**Docker Integration Issue:** Initially, we tried to run the application using Docker, but encountered issues. While the backend and frontend were successfully running in Docker containers, we faced challenges with data flow between the containers. Specifically, the sample data generated by the backend wasn't displayed correctly in the frontend.

**Alternate Setup:** To overcome these issues, we used the batch file (start.bat) to manually start the backend, sample data generator, and frontend. This method ensures that all components function correctly and demonstrates the full application behavior without the Docker-related data flow problems.

**Requirements**  
Python (for backend)  
Node.js and npm (for frontend)
